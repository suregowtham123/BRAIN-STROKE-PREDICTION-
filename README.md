# ðŸ§  Brain Stroke Detection with 6 DOF Robotic Simulation

This project aims to detect the risk of brain stroke using machine learning techniques and simulate a **6 DOF (Degrees of Freedom)** robotic arm that assists in medical diagnostics. The robot is enhanced with concepts of **Robotic CALM (Cooperative and Autonomous Learning Manipulator)**, **Focus**, and **Flair** to perform precision-based and adaptive tasks in a simulated healthcare environment.



## ðŸ§ª Project Overview

- âœ… **Brain Stroke Prediction** using ML models on patient health data.
- ðŸ¤– **6 DOF Robotic Arm Simulation** to mimic medical equipment alignment tasks.
- ðŸ§  **Robotic CALM**: Robot learns from environment to assist doctors more efficiently.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Focus**: Precision in targeting brain regions or patient data.
- âœ¨ **Flair**: Adaptive and smooth robot motion for enhanced user experience.
